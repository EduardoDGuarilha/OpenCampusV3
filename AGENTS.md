The project consists of an academic transparency portal with moderated anonymous evaluations. Almost all the folder structure and files have been created but will be by default empty unless they have already been altered during the project and waiting to be populated or altered, always prioritize populating the file that fits your needs but be free to create new files if needed. The backend uses ASP.NET Core + EF Core + SQLite, organized into: Data (DbContext, migrations, initialization), Entities (EF Core models and relations), DTOs (input/output models for requests and responses), Services (business logic and database access using async repository patterns), Controllers (thin API endpoints using attribute routing), Auth (JWT authentication with ASP.NET Identity–compatible hashing and role-based authorization), and Configuration (appsettings and dependency injection). The frontend uses React with Vite and Tailwind, with pages for login/registration, institution, course, professor, subject, review creation, and moderation panel. The required entities are User, Institution, Course, Professor, Subject, Review, Comment, and ChangeRequest. In User, never expose cpf, password_hash, or the student’s email. Reviews contain target_type, 1–5 scores for fixed criteria, text, and approved. Comments contain text and a reference to the Review. ChangeRequests contain the target type, suggested data, status pending/approved/rejected, and records of who created and resolved them. The business rules must be strictly followed: only STUDENT can create Reviews; PROFESSOR and INSTITUTION cannot create Reviews; any authenticated user may comment on Reviews, but only approved Reviews may receive comments; validated PROFESSOR and INSTITUTION users may post official comments; each student may create at most one Review per institution, one per related course, one per professor, and one per subject (duplicates must generate error 409); every Review starts with approved=false and pending Reviews must never appear in public metrics; public listings show only approved Reviews unless the client explicitly requests the inclusion of pending ones. ChangeRequests may be created by any authenticated user; only MODERATOR may approve or reject and apply structural changes (e.g., renaming institution, course, professor, subject). The /admin panel is exclusive to moderators, who may list, approve, and reject pending Reviews and ChangeRequests, recording resolved_by and resolved_at. Moderators must never have access to sensitive user data. LGPD and anonymization are mandatory: CPF, password_hash, and student email must never appear in responses, logs, or error messages. Public reviews and comments must be anonymous and must never display author identifiers. Review authors must not be revealed, even in pending Reviews. Password hashing must use a secure algorithm such as ASP.NET Core Data Protection with PBKDF2 or bcrypt. All business logic must reside in services, never in controllers. Controllers must be thin, use correct DTOs, and strictly enforce permissions. Protected endpoints require JWT in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header. Roles: STUDENT creates Reviews and comments; PROFESSOR/INSTITUTION comment and create ChangeRequests; MODERATOR accesses /admin and performs full moderation. Before editing files, you must read the existing code and maintain style, naming, and architectural conventions. Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies, maintain SQLite compatibility, do not remove security validations, do not change business rules, and do not modify permission policies. Commits must be small, cohesive, and descriptive, without mixing concerns. Never expose sensitive data and never create shortcuts or behaviors that violate the rules described.
